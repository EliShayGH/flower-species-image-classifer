# Flower-Species Image Classifier Project
This Project is the final project of the Facebook PyTorch & Udacity Scholarship challenge - Phase 1.<br/>
In Phase 1, participated 10,000 students from all over the world in a challenge, only 300 of them were accepted to Phase 2 -  [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)<br/>
The goal was to create an AI model that detects a flower species by his image.<br/> For that purpose I designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network model. (VGG19 Transferred learning + Tunning)<br/>
The image datasets were taken from the [Oxford 102 Category Flower Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/)<br/>
Our models were tested by Facebook & Udacity teams, and 300 top students were granted a full scholarship based on their models' quality.<br/>
For the diversity, Facebook decided that only one student from each country will be accepted!<br/>
To my delight I managed to achieve ~94% accuracy on validation, and was chosen to receive the full scholarship as the Israeli representative
